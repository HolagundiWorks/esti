# AORMS-Studio interface audit — tracked issues

**Audit date:** 2026-07-11 · **Scope:** Authenticated **AORMS-Studio** workspace SPA (`studio.aorms.in`) — staff office shell, project workspace, libraries, finance, tasks, portals reachable while signed in. **Method:** Static code review + checklist pass against [NAVIGATION.md](NAVIGATION.md), [HCW-UI-KIT.md](HCW-UI-KIT.md), [HCW-UI-UX-PRINCIPLES.md](HCW-UI-UX-PRINCIPLES.md), [07-UX-REVIEW-CHECKLISTS.md](../hcw-kit/07-UX-REVIEW-CHECKLISTS.md), and [AORMS-UI-AUTOPILOT-ROADMAP.md](AORMS-UI-AUTOPILOT-ROADMAP.md). **No live user testing. Audit only — no fixes in this pass.**

**Companion audits:** [11-audits/README.md](../hcw-kit/11-audits/README.md) (index) · [PUBLIC-PAGES-AUDIT-2026-07-11.md](../marketing/PUBLIC-PAGES-AUDIT-2026-07-11.md) · [SECURITY-AUDIT-2026-07-11.md](SECURITY-AUDIT-2026-07-11.md) · [DESIGN-DEBT-REGISTER.md](../hcw-kit/11-audits/DESIGN-DEBT-REGISTER.md)

## Executive summary

| Area | Score | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Glass rail shell (U0–U6)** | 97% | ✅ Rollout complete; Studio Intelligence uses intentional custom geometry |
| **Navigation IA vs NAVIGATION.md** | 90% | ◐ Mostly synced; doc gaps on KB portal + capability gates |
| **ActionDock adoption** | 79% | ◐ 27 route files use `useScreenActions`; 8 screens use inline/row CTAs |
| **Breadcrumbs + tab titles** | 79% | ◐ 29 screens; `/` and legacy embeds missing |
| **Dialog accessibility** | 92% | ◐ All gaps in parallel-WIP `Projects.tsx` / `Clients.tsx` |
| **Loading grammar** | 85% | ◐ DataState widespread; 3 routes still bare text |
| **Status indicators** | 95% | ◐ `Clients.tsx` TagChip fork (registered D11) |
| **UX checklist (aggregate)** | 82% | Defined / shippable; polish queue below |

**Overall:** AORMS-Studio interface is **production-grade** on shell geometry and kit adoption. Remaining debt clusters in **parallel-WIP CRM screens**, **breadcrumb/title on home**, **NAV doc drift**, and **a handful of inline CTAs**.

---

## Method

1. Route inventory from `frontend/src/App.tsx` (staff branch ~572–751).
2. Shell detection: `RailLayout`, custom `esti-glass-dash`, `PortalShell`, `ExternalPortalShell`.
3. Checklist sweeps: `useScreenActions`, `PageBreadcrumb`, `DataState`, `StatusDot`/`StatusTag`, dialog `aria-labelledby`.
4. Cross-check admin nav tree vs [NAVIGATION.md](NAVIGATION.md) § Shipped chrome.
5. Compare rollout status vs [AORMS-UI-AUTOPILOT-ROADMAP.md](AORMS-UI-AUTOPILOT-ROADMAP.md) U0–U6 (marked ✅ 2026-07-10).

## 1. Shell & spatial model

| Surface | Shell | File | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Studio Intelligence `/` | Custom glass dash | `StudioAbstract.tsx` | Canonical reference — not wrapped in `RailLayout` (intentional) |
| 32 staff list/detail screens | `RailLayout` + `esti-glass-dash` | `RailLayout.tsx` | Global glass rail SCSS |
| Project detail | `RailLayout` + rail tabs | `ProjectDetail.tsx` | `ProjectRailNav` in rail |
| Account / company account | `PortalShell` → kit `GlassRail` | `AccountPortal.tsx`, `CompanyAccountPortal.tsx` | Roadmap U5 approved alternate |
| Client / consultant / site portals | `ExternalPortalShell` | `Portal.tsx`, `CollaboratorPortal.tsx`, `SitePortal.tsx` | U5 ✅ |
| Auth gates | `AuthRailLayout` | `Login.tsx`, etc. | Rail-first auth ✅ |
| Contractor portal | Stub | `ContractorPortalStub.tsx` | Minimal — not glass rail |

**Outer chrome (all staff):** `esti-app-shell2` · floating `AppRibbon` · `AppFooterBar` · global `ActionDock` (`App.tsx`).

**Pass:** Rail holds instruments; stage holds work; footer launchers match NAV § Taskbar.

## 6. Parallel WIP files (do not edit until flag cleared)

Policy: `CLAUDE.md` · [AORMS-UI-AUTOPILOT-ROADMAP.md](AORMS-UI-AUTOPILOT-ROADMAP.md) § Autopilot rules #6.

| File | Shell | Dock | Breadcrumb | DataState | Status UI | Dialog a11y |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Projects.tsx` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ StatusTag | ❌ I2 |
| `Clients.tsx` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ TagChip I3 | ❌ I1 |

**When WIP lifts:** I1, I2, I3 are the only blockers for full checklist compliance on CRM entry points.

## 7. Autopilot roadmap cross-check (U0–U6)

| Phase | Status | Audit note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| U0 Glass rail reference | ✅ | `StudioAbstract.tsx` |
| U1 Shared primitives | ✅ | `RailLayout.tsx`, `glass.scss` |
| U2 Login rail | ✅ | `AuthRailLayout` |
| U3 Screen rollout | ✅ | All batch screens on RailLayout |
| U4 Health orbs | ✅ | Optional on non-home screens |
| U5 Portals | ✅ | External + account shells |
| U6 Kit export | ✅ | `@hcw/ui-kit` primitives |

**Per-screen checklist (roadmap § U3):**

- [x] Upgraded `RailLayout` — no local rail geometry
- [x] Rail: title/tabs/aside only — no DataGrid in rail (project detail excepted: section nav)
- [x] Stage scrolls independently
- [ ] Page CTAs via `useScreenActions` everywhere — **I8, I9, I15**
- [x] Typecheck — pre-existing KBP TS errors only (I18)

| --- | --- | --- |
| I3 | D11 | TagChip fork in `Clients.tsx` |
| I8 | D1b | Optimistic / inline CTA pattern |
